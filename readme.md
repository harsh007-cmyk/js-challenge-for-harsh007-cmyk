# Users

In this repository I built a form validation using html css and Javascript and the data will be shown in last row of table after submission of the form. If there is any error in form submission error message will display below the heading 'Users'.

When web page loads Data from api will show in table. If any error occur in fetch api it will show error message "Something went wrong while fetching the users." below submit button.

|Input field  |Error message  |
|-------------|---------------|
|First name   |First name must contain atleast three alphanumberic characters (only alphanumeric is   allowed).|
|Last name    |Last name must contain atleast three alphanumberic characters (only alphanumeric is allowed).|
|Username     |Username can't be blank and only dot and alphanumeric are allowed.|
|Email        |Invalid Email.|
|Address      |Address can't be blank.|
|Phone number |Invalid phone number.|
|Website      |Invalid website|


For webiste input field user should Enter url of of the website.<br />
eg: 'github.com' will give error but 'https://github.com/' won't give any error. 
The web page is responsive.
